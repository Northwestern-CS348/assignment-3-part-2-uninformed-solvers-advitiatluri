"""
For a game with 8 tiles of blocks on a 3x3 grid,
write down the Facts and Rules to model the game state 
shown as the follows:

 y\\x   pos1     pos2     pos3
     ----------------------------
pos1 | tile5  | tile4  | empty  |
     ----------------------------
pos2 | tile6  | tile1  | tile8  |
     ----------------------------
pos3 | tile7  | tile3  | tile2  |
     ----------------------------

fact: (pred obj1 obj2)
rule: ((pred obj1 obj2) (pred obj2 obj3)) -> (pred obj1 obj3)
